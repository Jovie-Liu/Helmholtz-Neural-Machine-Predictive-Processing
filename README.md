# Helmholtz-Neural-Machine-Predictive-Processing

This research aims to implement [predictive processing](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rstb/article/370/1668/20140169/22572/Cerebral-hierarchies-predictive-processing), a core brain mechanism, using a neural network model, the Helmholtz machine, through its disentangled bottom-up and top-down processing pathways.

## Research

- I devised a mechanism to implement predictive processing and Bayesian brain inference using the Helmholtz machine. Predictive processing performs a “Bayesian flip” upon the standard image of sensory processing that modulates bottom-up recognition by top-down predictions.
- The precision-weighted modulation of the recognition process also led the model to resist the long-standing problem in machine learning called **catastrophic forgetting**, which is demonstrated by a series of designed numerical experiments.
- The unique mode of attention-modulated learning by predictive processing paves the way for solving the problems in selective attention (e.g., the [cocktail party effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)), [theory of expectation](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/1961/Sweet-AnticipationMusic-and-the-Psychology-of), and [theory of mind](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sjp.12120).
