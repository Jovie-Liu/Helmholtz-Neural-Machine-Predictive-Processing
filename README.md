# Helmholtz-Neural-Machine-Predictive-Processing

This research aims to implement [predictive processing](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rstb/article/370/1668/20140169/22572/Cerebral-hierarchies-predictive-processing), a core brain mechanism, using a neural network model, the Helmholtz machine, through its disentangled bottom-up and top-down processing pathways.
